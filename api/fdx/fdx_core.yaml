                    into the Dining category if they primarily prepare food and
                    drinks for immediate consumption on the premises or for
                    take-out. Dining merchants include bars, cocktail lounges,
                    nightclubs, taverns and fast-food restaurants. Some
                    merchants that sell food and drinks are located within
                    larger establishments that sell other goods and services and
                    may not be not included in this category. For example a
                    department store or hotel restaurant, theme park cafes or
                    discount store food counter would not be categorized under
