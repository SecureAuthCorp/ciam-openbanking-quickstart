          An array of case sensitive strings for authentication methods that are used in the user
          authentication.

          For example, an IDP may require the user to provide a biometric authentication using facial
          recognition. For that, the value of the authentication method reference is `face`.

          Subject identifiers are locally unique and never reassigned identifiers within the Issuer
          for the end-user and are inteded to be consumed by client applications. There are two types
          of subject identifiers: `public` and `pairwise`.

          For the `public` type, the value of the `sub` (subject) token claim is the same for all clients.

          For the `pairwise` type, a different `sub` (subject) token claim is provided for each client.

          Subject identifiers are locally unique and never reassigned identifiers within the Issuer
          for the end-user and are inteded to be consumed by client applications. There are two types
          of subject identifiers: `public` and `pairwise`.

          For the `public` type, the value of the `sub` (subject) token claim is the same for all clients.

          For the `pairwise` type, a different `sub` (subject) token claim is provided for each client.
          Using the `pairwise` subject identifier makes it impossible for client applications to correlate the end-user's
          activity without their permission.

          response includes an authorization code

          `code token` - when supplied as the value for the `response_type` parameter, a successful
          response includes an access token, an access token type, and an authorization code

          `id_token token` - when supplied as the value for the `response_type` parameter, a successful
          response includes an access token, an access token type, and an ID token

          `code id_token token` - when supplied as the value for the `response_type` parameter, a successful
          response includes an authorization code, an ID token, an access token, and an access token
          type.

          `token` - when supplied as the value for the `response_type` parameter, a successful
          response includes an access token and its type. This argument is used for the implicit grant
          flow, but is not recommended. Instead, you should use either the authorization code grant
          flow with PKCE or client authentication set to `none` and with the use of PKCE.

          Subject identifiers are locally unique and never reassigned identifiers within the Issuer
          for the end-user and are inteded to be consumed by client applications. There are two types
          of subject identifiers: `public` and `pairwise`.

          For the `public` type, the value of the `sub` (subject) token claim is the same for all clients.

          For the `pairwise` type, a different `sub` (subject) token claim is provided for each client.
          Using the `pairwise` subject identifier makes it impossible for client applications to correlate the end-user's
          activity without their permission.

      Conta poupança - foi criada para estimular as pessoas a pouparem. O dinheiro que ficar na conta por trinta dias passa a gerar rendimentos, com isenção de imposto de renda para quem declara. Ou seja, o dinheiro “cresce” (rende) enquanto ficar guardado na conta. Cada depósito terá rendimentos de mês em mês, sempre no dia do mês em que o dinheiro tiver sido depositado

          TierBandMethod

          The methodology of how credit interest is paid/applied. It can be:-

          1. Banded
          Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.

          2. Tiered
          Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.

          3. Whole
          The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the BCA balance

          AER

          The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is calculated under the assumption that any interest paid is combined with the original balance and the next interest payment will be based on the slightly higher account balance. Overall, this means that interest can be compounded several times in a year depending on the number of times that interest payments are made.

          Refers to which interest rate is applied when interests are tiered. For example, if an overdraft balance is £2k and the interest tiers are:- 0-£500 0.1%, 500-1000 0.2%, 1000-10000 0.5%, then the applicable interest rate could either be 0.5% of the entire balance (since the account balance sits in the top interest tier) or (0.1%*500)+(0.2%*500)+(0.5%*1000). In the 1st situation, we say the interest is applied to the ‘Whole’ of the account balance,  and in the 2nd that it is ‘Tiered’.

          Market segmentation is a marketing term referring to the aggregating of prospective buyers into groups, or segments, that have common needs and respond similarly to a marketing action. Market segmentation enables companies to target different categories of consumers who perceive the full value of certain products and services differently from one another.

          Market segmentation is a marketing term referring to the aggregating of prospective buyers into groups, or segments, that have common needs and respond similarly to a marketing action. Market segmentation enables companies to target different categories of consumers who perceive the full value of certain products and services differently from one another.

          The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is calculated under the assumption that any interest paid is combined with the original balance and the next interest payment will be based on the slightly higher account balance. Overall, this means that interest can be compounded several times in a year depending on the number of times that interest payments are made.
          For SME Loan, this APR is the representative APR which includes any account fees.

          Identifier - URI - que  atribudo sob o URI scheme "urn" e um namespace URN especfico, com a inteno de que o URN
          seja um identificador de recurso persistente e independente da localizao.
          Considerando a string urn:bancoex:C1DD33123 como exemplo para consentId temos:
          o namespace(urn)
          o identificador associado ao namespace da instituio transnmissora (bancoex)

          Client applications can be either of a `web` or `native` types.

          Web applications include clients like server web applications or service apps.

          Native applications include single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile or desktop
          applications.

          Depending on the type of your application remember to choose appropriate security measures.

          String represented type of a client application

          Client applications can be either of a `web` or `native` types.

          Web applications include clients like server web applications or service apps.

          Native applications include single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile or desktop
          applications.

          Depending on the type of your application remember to choose appropriate security measures.

          Depending on the policy type the policy can be assigned to different policy
          execution points.

          A policy of the `user` type can be assigned only to the following scopes: `scope_user_grant`,
          `server_user_token`, `client_user_token`.

          A `developer` policy can be assigned only to the `scope_client_assignment` and
          `server_client_assignment` scopes.

          A policy of the `machine` type can be assigned only to the following scopes:
          `scope_machine_grant`, `server_machine_token`, `client_machine_token`.

          A `dcr` policy can be assigned only to the `scope_dynamic_client_registration` and the

          String representation of the policy execution point type

          Policies can be assigned to different policy execution points. For example, you can create a
          policy that you want to trigger while calls are made to your APIs. In this
          case, the type of the policy execution point is `api`. While
          choosing the policies that are applied for API calls, only those with the
          `api` type are available.

          public clients.

          Public clients, like mobile applications or JavaScript-based applications, by their design,
          cannot store client secrets securely. For such clients, even encrypting the client secret
          inside the application’s code is not a reliable way of protecting secrets as the application
          can be decompiled and the client secret can be extracted while it is decrypted in the memory
          of the application.

          For those reasons, ACP supports the use of PKCE as an addition to the authorization code

          The content of JSON Web Tokens is readable and it is possible to be decoded by anyone that
          has a secret or a public key in their possession.

          Opaque tokens are in a proprietary form that contains an identifier to information stored on

          Public clients, like mobile applications or JavaScript-based applications, by their design,
          cannot store client secrets securely. For such clients, even encrypting the client secret
          inside the application’s code is not a reliable way of protecting secrets as the application
          can be decompiled and the client secret can be extracted while it is decrypted in the memory
          of the application.

          For those reasons, ACP supports the use of PKCE as an addition to the authorization code

          is used, for instance, to choose among a set of keys within a JWK Set
          during key rollover.  The structure of the "kid" value is
          unspecified.  When "kid" values are used within a JWK Set, different
          keys within the JWK Set SHOULD use distinct "kid" values.  (One
          example in which different keys might use the same "kid" value is if
          they have different "kty" (key type) values but are considered to be
          equivalent alternatives by the application using them.)  The "kid"
          value is a case-sensitive string.

        x-go-name: Kid
      kty:
        description: |-
          The "kty" (key type) parameter identifies the cryptographic algorithm
          family used with the key, such as "RSA" or "EC". "kty" values should
          either be registered in the IANA "JSON Web Key Types" registry
          established by [JWA] or be a value that contains a Collision-
          Resistant Name.  The "kty" value is a case-sensitive string.

          ACP supports creating Cloudentity policies (using a visual editor or defined using JSON or
          YAML) and Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies (defined using REGO).

          OPA is a policy engine that unifies policy enforcement and provides a high-level declarative
          language (REGO) that lets you specify policies as code. REGO supports referencing nested
          documents and ensures that your queries are correct and unambiguous.

          If your token endpoint authentication is set to the `private_key_jwt` method, the
          `token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg` parameter must be either RS256, ES256, or PS256.

          If your token endpoint authentication is set to the `client_secret_jwt` method,
          the `token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg` parameter must be HS256.

          String represented type of a client application

          Client applications can be either of a `web` or `native` types.

          Web applications include clients like server web applications or service apps.

          Native applications include single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile or desktop
          applications.

          Depending on the type of your application remember to choose appropriate security measures.
